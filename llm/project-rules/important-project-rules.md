# Important Project Rules - Tupaia

This file contains essential Tupaia-specific information for LLM agents.

## Current Status

No project-specific rules have been identified yet. All current guidance is handled by the shared common rules.

## Git Workflow

- **Create all branches off `dev`** - not master
- Feature branches merge to `dev`, then `dev` merges to `master` fortnightly as releases

## Future Rule Loading

This section will be populated as Tupaia-specific patterns are identified that require special handling beyond the shared common rules.
