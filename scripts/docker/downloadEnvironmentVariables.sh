# Fetch environment from LastPass, write to ${ENV_DEST}/${DEPLOYMENT_NAME}/.env
# Is modified from ../../scripts/bash/downloadEnvironmentVariables.sh

# Attempting multiple logins to LastPass from the same IP in succession often
# results in LastPass blocking the IP for some time. To avoid getting blocked
# the script can be run by a "non essential" container in the ECS Task to fetch
# configuration from LastPass prior to the application containers starting. The
# configuration is written to a Docker volume which can be mounted into each
# application container.

# The following changes have been made to the original script:

# - By not being in the ../../scripts/bash directory, modifications to this
#   script don't invalidate the Docker cache prior to the application packages
#   build. This was done to speed up development and testing of the script.
#
# - Containers running in the ECS task will read env files from a common volume
#   mount. To support this a destination directory needs to be provided as the
#   first argument.
#
# - The fallback to 'dev' environments has been removed, if the specified
#   deployment name is missing from the LastPass vault the script will error.

# Usage: downloadEnvironmentVariables.sh <deployment-name> <env-root-dir> [package]...
