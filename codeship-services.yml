# In setting up these services, I have tried to minimise how much is loaded into each container for
# each step in order to speed up those individual step build + run times
# - 'validation' service includes a nodejs container, plus the full repo code, and any node_modules
#   dependencies for the package in question
# - 'testing' service is the same as the validation service, but additionally depends on the db
#   service (see below)
# - 'cypress' service includes a base cypress container, plus code and node_module dependencies
#   required by e2e tests in web-frontend
# - the 'db' service provides a postgres db with postgis (and takes a little while to run, thus the
#   splitting of the above services so validation isn't slower than it should be)
# - the 'front-end-deployment' service is similar to the validation service, but only adds the code
#   required to build and deploy the front end packages
# - the deployment service just uses the base alpine image + ssh to log into an ec2 instance and
#   deploy the latest version of the code for each package, including pulling and running the latest
#   docker image containing the built front ends
