# In setting up these services, I have tried to minimise how much is loaded into each container for
# each step in order to speed up those individual step build + run times
# - 'validation' service includes a nodejs container, plus the full repo code, and any node_modules
#   dependencies for the package in question
# - 'testing' service is the same as the validation service, but additionally depends on the db
#   service (see below)
# - 'cypress' service includes a base cypress container, plus code and node_module dependencies
#   required by e2e tests in web-frontend
# - the 'db' service provides a postgres db with postgis (and takes a little while to run, thus the
#   splitting of the above services so validation isn't slower than it should be)
# - the 'lastpass' service is simply set up to be able to communicate with LastPass, to fetch
#   environment variables
# - the 'builder' service uses the same image as the 'testing' service, but skips the dependency on
#   the db, and makes the built files available to the later deployment step
# - the 'deployment' service just uses the base alpine image + ssh to log into an ec2 instance and
#   deploy the latest version of the code for each package
