 * Replace question code with question UUID in an expression.
 *
 * Important: This function also assumes that all the variables in an expression have prefix '$'
 * because some question codes can start with numbers.
 *
 * Eg:
 * ($SchFF00Section1Total / $SchFF00Section1TotalObtainable) * 100
 * will be converted to:
 * ($5ed7558b61f76a6ba5003114 / $5ec5bf8961f76a18ad00d4f9) * 100
 *
 * Inverse operation: replaceQuestionIdsWithCodes
 * @param {*} models
 * @param {*} expression Expression to evaluate (assumes that all the variables in an expression have prefix '$')
 * @param {*} codes: List of question codes (with no prefix $)
