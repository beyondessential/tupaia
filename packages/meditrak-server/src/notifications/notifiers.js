This is just to let you know that you've been added to the ${permissionGroup.name} access group

and to see reports and map overlays on Tupaia.org

Please note that you'll need to log out and then log back in to get access to the new permissions.

Have fun exploring Tupaia, and feel free to get in touch if you have any questions.`;
