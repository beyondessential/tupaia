/**
 * Survey responses use an `outdated` flag to indicate whether their values should be used
 * for analytics building. This flag mainly depends on the survey response data time and on the
 * `period_granularity` of its parent survey.
 *
 * * For surveys with no `period_granularity`: no responses are outdated, or in
 * other words they all contribute towards analytics building
 *
 * * For  surveys with a `period_granularity` ("periodic"): only one response per
 * survey/entity/period combination will contribute towards analytics building;
 * the rest should be marked as outdated. This one response is selected on the basis of most
 * recent submission time
 *
 * Here, we refer to the survey/entity/period combo as "response dimension combo".
 * Example: Basic Clinic Survey/Tonga/July 2021
 *
 * @typedef { surveyId, entityId, startDate, endDate } ResponseDimensionCombo
