# Creates a new deployment of Tupaia with a specific branch checked out
#
# Example configs
#
# 1. Spin up a new feature branch deployment of Tupaia, that will be deleted after 8 hours
# {
#   "Action": "spin_up_tupaia_deployment",
#   "User": "edwin",
#   "Branch": "wai-965",
#   "HoursOfLife": "8"
# }
#
# 2. Spin up a new deployment of Tupaia, but with the db cloned from dev and a different branch
#    checked out (wai-965) to its url prefix (timing-test), and specifying the instance type
# {
#   "Action": "spin_up_tupaia_deployment",
#   "User": "edwin",
#   "DeploymentName": "timing-test",
#   "Branch": "wai-965",
#   "CloneDbFrom": "dev",
#   "InstanceType": "t3.2xlarge"
# }
#
# 3. Spin up a new deployment of Tupaia, but using a different AMI for the server and different base
#    instance for the db
# {
#   "Action": "spin_up_tupaia_deployment",
#   "User": "edwin",
#   "Branch": "wai-965",
#   "ImageCode": "edwin-test-server",
#   "SecurityGroupCode": "edwin-test-server",
#   "CloneDbFrom": "edwin-test-db"
# }
# N.B. example 3 is unusual and generally just used for debugging the redeploy process itself. If
# used, you need to tag the AMI and security groups with the codes you specify
