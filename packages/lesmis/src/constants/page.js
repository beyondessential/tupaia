          Fundamental Quality Standards-based school development
        </Typography>
        <Typography gutterBottom>
          The MoES Primary Fundamental Quality Standards (FQS) aim to support schools in their
          development efforts; ultimately aimed at enhancing student learning.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          The FQS define what a school should aim to achieve. The FQS-based school self-assessment
          and development planning process supports schools in identifying:
        </Typography>
        <List>
          <ListItem component="li">
            those standards that are achieved, some of which may be considered strengths or “good
            practices” that could be shared with other cluster schools.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem component="li">
            those standards that need improvement -&gt priorities for improvement to be included in
            the school development plan.
          </ListItem>
        </List>
        <Typography gutterBottom>
          The FQS-based school development process is ICT-enabled, meaning it promotes the use of
          online questionnaires to support schools in their self-assessment and development
          planning.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          The online submitted data on your school will be presented on the LESMIS platform in
          easy-to-understand formats, like the School profile. This will allow for better targeting
          of support to schools (see{' '}

        <Typography>
          The successful development of your school depends on the strong participation and

          FQS-based school development planning process
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          The school development planning process is made up of four Steps. Preparations by the
          School Development Planning Taskforce (Step 1) start in early December. The school
          development plan should be completed by second week of January the latest to be able to
          inform the district education costed annual action plan (ACEP).

          School Support Categories
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          The enhanced ICT enabled school development process aim for the identification of schools’
          strengths and areas for improvement based on the FQS Part 1, 2 and 3. The FQS data allow
          for allocating schools in one of the three School Support Categories. Schools that do less
          well will receive more support from the DESB. The ‘support package’ is quantified in the
          number of days of support (school visits) by pedagogical advisors and/or other DESB staff
          each year.
