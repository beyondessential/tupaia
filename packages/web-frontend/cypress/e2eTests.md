# e2e Tests

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is used as the end-to-end test framework. This is the root folder of the test code and its configuration.

## Installation

1. If you haven't already, follow the instructions in [Tupaia Monorepo setup](https://docs.beyondessential.com.au/books/software-development/page/tupaia-monorepo-setup) to setup this project.

   ‚ö†Ô∏è: In **Step 2. Install node dependencies** you need to run the commands under a Windows terminal, see the note in that section.

2. Make sure that you have a valid `.env` file under `packages/web-frontend` - see [.env.example](../.env.example) for the required variables.

   > If you want to point to a local backend, set the following in `.env`:
   >
   > ```bash
   > REACT_APP_CONFIG_SERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1/
   > ```

3. The tests depend on `.json` configuration files that must be placed under `cypress/config`. To generate the default config:

   ```bash
   yarn workspace @tupaia/web-frontend cypress:generate-config
   ```

   You can also use custom config by manually populating those files. See the [config docs](config/e2eTestsConfig.md) for more details

## Running the tests locally

We first need to start the servers locally, then run the e2e tests. We can run the tests in either UI or terminal (headless) mode.

### üçé MacOS

- UI mode: `yarn workspace @tupaia/web-frontend test:cypress:open`
- Terminal mode: `yarn workspace @tupaia/web-frontend test:cypress:open`

### ‚äû Windows

Run the following in **WSL**:

```bash
# In one terminal
yarn workspace @tupaia/web-config-server start
# In another terminal
yarn workspace @tupaia/web-frontend start
```

Then, run one of the following commands in a **Windows terminal**:

- UI mode: `yarn workspace @tupaia/web-frontend test:cypress:open`
- Terminal mode: `yarn workspace @tupaia/web-frontend test:cypress:open`

## Limitations

### Dashboard reports
