TUPAIA OPEN SOURCE LICENSE

Version 1, July 2020

This open source license operates as a waiver of the copyright holder’s Copyright and Similar Rights in this work provided that:

    1. the purpose of any reproduction is and is only to facilitate or improve the delivery of health services or education to persons living in territories defined by the World Bank as Low Income or Lower-Middle Income Economies (“Beneficiaries”);

    2. the use of any reproduction is and is only to facilitate or improve the delivery of health services or education to Beneficiaries;

    3. any work containing any modification of this work is not made available by a modifier to or for use by any third party other than in circumstances in which:

        a. the object code and corresponding source code, in the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program, of the entirety of the work containing any modification of this work is made readily and freely available to all persons by download via the Internet

    4. this license, unmodified including title and version date, is applied to and conspicuously published on each reproduction of and on the entirety of any work containing any modification of this work without application of any inconsistent additional conditions.

    5. each reproduction and the entirety of any work containing any modification of this work retains any supplied identification of the creator(s) of the work and any others designated to receive attribution in any reasonable manner requested by the copyright holder (including by pseudonym if designated).

In this license, “Copyright and Similar Rights” means copyright and rights closely related to copyright (including rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world) without regard to how the rights are labelled or categorized.

Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this license, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the copyright holder waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by it to the limited extent necessary to allow you to exercise the rights you otherwise do have pursuant to this license.

Patent and trade mark rights are not the subject of this license. 

The copyright holder does not permit the use of or waive any right in respect of its name or trade marks except for the purposes of users’ compliance with item 4 above. 

To the extent permitted by applicable law, no warranty is given in respect of the copyright holder’s work. The work is made available for reproduction and use as described above “as is” without warranty of any kind express or implied including any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for purpose.

In no event will the copyright holder be liable for damages of any nature in respect of any use of the work as described above (including but not limited to damages for loss of data) even if the copyright holder has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability set out above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, the court shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the work unless the claimant has the benefit of a warranty or assumption of liability given in respect of the work in return for a fee.
